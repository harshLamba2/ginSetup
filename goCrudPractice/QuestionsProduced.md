1. what is &models.Countries{} ?
2. instance ?
3. * is refrence again confirm/ read in depth that how

WHEN {} is used with structs in GORM;
CODE: ( 
var groupedCountries []struct{
    Country string `json:"country"`
    Count   int    `json:"count"`
}

// Query: Grouping by the "country" column and counting the occurrences.
db.Model(&models.Country{}).Select("country, count(*) as count").Group("country").Find(&groupedCountries)

)

EXPLAINATION(
    
    The reason for using {} in Model(&models.Country{}) and not in Find(&groupedCountries) relates to how GORM handles the data and struct types during query building and result retrieval.

Explanation:
1. Model(&models.Country{}):
Purpose: The Model method is used to specify which database table the query is targeting. When you pass &models.Country{}, you're telling GORM to use the Country model struct as a reference to generate the appropriate SQL query (i.e., it maps to the countries table in the database, assuming standard pluralization).
Why {}: The curly braces ({}) signify an empty instance of the Country struct. GORM doesn't need data in this struct when generating the query, it just uses it to figure out the table name and structure.

2. Find(&groupedCountries):
Purpose: The Find method is used to retrieve the results of the query and store them into the provided slice or struct. In your case, you're passing &groupedCountries which is a slice of anonymous structs.
Why no {}: You don't need to instantiate the structs in Find because GORM will populate this slice with the results from the database. You're passing a reference to the groupedCountries slice, and GORM will automatically append the query results to it.

7. Transaction Management:
Handle transactions for atomic operations (commit/rollback).

8. Security:
Prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries.
Securely store sensitive data like passwords (hashing).

9. Error Handling:
Properly handle database errors and connection failures in your Gin app.

10. Query Optimization:
Learn to optimize database queries to ensure performance in production.


API VERSIONING

    API versioning is the practice of managing changes to your API over time while maintaining backward compatibility. As your API evolves, you may need to introduce new features, fix bugs, or change the structure of responses without breaking existing client applications that depend on earlier versions.

1. Backward Compatibility: Ensure old clients can still use the older versions of the API while new clients can benefit from updated functionality.
2. Controlled Evolution: Allows for gradual migration from older versions to newer ones without disrupting services.
3. New Features/Breaking Changes: Safely introduce new features or breaking changes (e.g., data format changes, new fields).
